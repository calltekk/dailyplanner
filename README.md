## Overview

The Daily Planner is a simple calendar application designed to help users manage their busy schedules effectively. With a clean and intuitive interface, this app allows users to plan and organize their daily tasks during standard business hours.

## Features

- **Current Day Display:** The app prominently displays the current day at the top of the calendar, providing users with up-to-date information.

- **Timeblocks:** Timeblocks for standard business hours are presented as rows, each containing an hour, a text area for entering events, and a save button.

- **Color-Coded Timeblocks:** Each timeblock is color-coded based on whether it's in the past, present, or future. Past hours are grey, the current hour is red, and future hours are green.

- **Event Saving:** Users can enter events for each hour and save them with the click of a button. Saved events persist between page refreshes.
